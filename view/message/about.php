        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <p class="about-info">NextBid was born from a shared vision between Uzziah Lukeka and Akbarali Nabiev. In 2022, while working 
           on a freelance project together, they realized the potential for a new kind of auction platformâ€”one 
           that could leverage modern technology to create a more accessible, efficient, and transparent auction experience. 
           Combining Uzziah's expertise in backend development and Akbarali's flair for creative design, they set out to build 
           NextBid from the ground up.</p>
        <p class="about-info">Starting from a small garage in Uzziah's hometown, the duo faced numerous challenges, from securing funding 
           to developing a robust platform that could handle high traffic and transactions securely. Their determination 
           and complementary skills, however, saw them through these early hurdles. They launched the first version of NextBid 
           in late 2022, quickly gaining traction due to its user-friendly interface and innovative features.</p>
        <p class="about-info">Today, NextBid stands as a testament to their hard work and vision, connecting buyers and sellers from all 
           over the world and revolutionizing the way auctions are conducted. With a growing team and an ever-expanding 
           user base, Uzziah and Akbarali continue to drive NextBid forward, always looking for new ways to innovate and 
           improve the auction experience for everyone involved.</p>
