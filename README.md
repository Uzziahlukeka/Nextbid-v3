# NextBid

## Project Overview
NextBid is an online auction system designed to enable users to list and bid on items across various categories. The project integrates a REST API with an MVC model, focusing on building a distributed system using PHP. 

### System Description
The system allows users to:
- Add, edit, and delete their profiles.
- Manage auctions by adding, editing, and removing auction items.
- Make payments through a sandbox environment for testing purposes.

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Management API**:
   - Add a user
   - Edit a user
   - Delete a user
   - Retrieve user information

2. **Auction Management API**:
   - Add an item to an auction
   - Edit an auction item
   - Remove an item from an auction
   - Download auction item details

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - Integrate a payment sandbox for secure transactions

4. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a front-end interface to interact with the auction system.

### API Folder Structure
To ensure the API functions correctly:
- I use my own API you can find in my repos
- run it on the port 8000: to deploy all files.
